  <h3>Definition</h3>
  <p> SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization, which is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to a website through organic search engine results.The definition can be broken down into three parts:</p>
  <ol>
    <li> <I> <strong>Quality of traffic.</strong> A website can attract all the visitors in the world, but if they're coming to the site because Google tells them it is a resource for Apple computers when really it is a farmer selling apples, that is not quality traffic. Instead, a website wants to attract visitors who are genuinely interested in the products that it offers. </I> </li> <br>
    <li> <I> <strong>Quantity of traffic.</strong> Once the website has the right people clicking through from those search engine results pages (SERPs), more traffic is better.</I> </li> <br>
    <li> <I> <strong>Organic results.</strong> Ads make up a significant portion of many SERPs. Organic traffic is any traffic that a site doesn't have to pay for.</I> </li> <br>
  </ol>
